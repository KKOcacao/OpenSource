This Program was written for my Artificial Intelligence course.

A rule-based inference engine was built in the jcd5044.h class, and the rules were read in from the jcd5044.dat1 file.
It was then uploaded to the teachers website, and pitted against other rule-based, neural network, and genetic algorithms; hence the need for the username naming convention.
The game resembles the "Tron" light cycle game, or a two player game of snake.

All rule-based algorithms beat non-rule-based algorithms, with ours coming in 2nd overall.
