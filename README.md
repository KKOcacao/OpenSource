OpenSource
==========

This is my public repository for small/unfinished projects. I'm currently in the process of digging up old school projects to place here in order to have a better overall portfolio.
It's an ongoing process, and things will be added as I find them, get them from partners/former partners, or am certain I have the proper permission to do so.
